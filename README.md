The Smurfs are great travelers, as everyone knows! They must regularly go on expeditions, guided by the Great Smurf. They have located a magical terrain where a lot of sarsaparilla grows. However, the path leading there presents certain challenges to overcome; there are enemies that could block the way.

When a Smurf leaves the village and enters the forest, random objects (Items) and insects (Bugs, a bug can be either a Spider or a Bzz Fly) are placed on the grid (the magical forest), including the Smurf itself. The initial coordinates must never exceed the range from -10 to 10, both inclusive (for an easy level), but entities can move farther during the game.

The objects will simply give a boost to the health of whoever walks over them:

A Red Potion: This potion, left by the Great Smurf, has the same effect as a berry but amplified. However, this potion was made for Smurfs, it can only have effects on Smurf-type creatures.
A Blue Potion: this potion is very useful. When activated, all creatures in the forest will be healed by a few points.
A Berry: this object will simply give a boost to the health of whoever walks over it.
